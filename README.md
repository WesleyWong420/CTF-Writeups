# CTF-Writeups
This is a repository of writeups for various jeopardy challenges from CTFs I have participated starting from 2021 - 2022. *Capture The Flag* is a type of computer security or hacking competition that generally involves breaking, investigating and reverse engineering a computer system to hunt for a *flag*, which is usually a specific string of text.
